# :video_game: Games

<p align="justify">
This repository contains two simple games made in Python: tic-tac-toe and battleships. Each game has two versions: one made to be played only in the terminal window and another to be played with a graphical user interface.

## Tic-Tac-Toe :hash:

<p align="justify">
The game tic-tac-toe is pretty much self-explanatory as nearly all of us played it at some point. In both versions, the user can choose whether they want to be X or O. In the terminal version, the user inputs x and y coordinates to make a move while on the GUI version the user clicks on the position to make a move. The user plays against the machine and the player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
